# AI-Tour-Planner
This project is an AI-powered travel planning assistant that generates personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences. It refines input, fetches real-time activity suggestions, and structures a day-by-day itinerary using AI models and web search.
Built with Python, Streamlit, and LangChain, it leverages Mistral AI for smart recommendations and Tavily API for up-to-date travel insights.
